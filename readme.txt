## Description

**Custom Blocks Plugin For WordPress**
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ<br>

**Developers magic wand for WordPress custom blocks.** We created [**Lazy Blocks WordPress plugin**](https://www.lazyblocks.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=head), to help every developer get access to the powerful tools they need to quickly run websites based on WordPress block editor (called Gutenberg).

[Official Site](https://www.lazyblocks.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=head) | [Documentation](https://www.lazyblocks.com/docs/overview/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=head) | [GitHub](https://github.com/nk-crew/lazy-blocks)

Create custom blocks visually, add controls to your blocks using drag & drop, write blocks output using HTML or PHP code. You can create custom blocks as well as custom meta fields for specific post types. Furthermore, you are able to create post templates with predefined blocks for any post type.

### üöÄ Easy To Start

This everything you need to deploy your custom block in WordPress editor:

**1. Configure Custom Block** <br> Give a name to your custom block, set icon, category, etc.

**2. Add Controls** <br> Add control fields like simple text and complex image selectors.

**3. Write Output Code** <br> Output code for your custom block with HTML and PHP support.

### üåü Features

* Custom blocks with output code
* Custom blocks for posts meta fields
* Large set of predefined controls
* Show controls in block content / inspector
* Multiple output methods allowed
  * Custom PHP
  * Custom HTML + Handlebars
  * Template files in theme folder
* Export / Import blocks

### üî• Controls

To manage custom blocks attributes you need to use Controls. Lazy Blocks have a large set of controls predefined for you:

* Basic
  * Text
  * Textarea
  * Number
  * Range
  * URL
  * Email
  * Password
* Content
  * Image

* Custom Controls [read our extensive documentation](https://www.lazyblocks.com/docs/examples/create-custom-control/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=custom_controls)

### üè≥Ô∏è Multilingual

Lazy Blocks adds a new layer of compatibility for [WPML](https://wpml.org/). All text controls of custom blocks are compatible with WPML and ready for translation. [https://www.lazyblocks.com/docs/multilingual/](https://www.lazyblocks.com/docs/multilingual/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wpml)

### üõ† Built For Developers

Lazy Blocks built by developers, for developers and gives you unlimited freedom to create custom blocks. Furthermore, there are PHP filters and actions to customize every part of your custom blocks from the backend. Possibility to use PHP and theme templates system.

Every UI part should be intuitive for simple custom blocks, but if you want to create something more complex, you may be required to [read our extensive documentation](https://www.lazyblocks.com/docs/overview/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=developers).

### üî• Lazy Blocks Pro

> The Lazy Blocks plugin is also available in a professional version which includes more controls and features! [**Learn more about Lazy Blocks Pro**](https://www.lazyblocks.com/pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=pro)
>
> In order to maintain the free version of the plugin on an ongoing basis, and to provide quick and effective support for free, we offer a Pro version of the plugin. The Pro version allows you to:

* **Additional Controls**

  * **Posts** - Search and select posts based on post type or taxonomy
  * **Taxonomy** - Search and select categories, tags and any other custom taxonomies
  * **Users** - Search and select users based on user roles
  * **Units** - Advanced number input with possibility to select any CSS unit
  * **Message** - Display a helpful message between controls
  * **Code Editor** - Insert code parts using editor with syntax highlighting

* **Controls Conditions**
Conditionally display/hide controls. In order not to overload your block with a huge list of controls, you can hide some of them depending on the values of other controls.

* **Panels and Dividers**
The Panels and Dividers provides a way to structure controls into groups. It assists in better organizing the block panel UI.

* **Blocks Preloading**
Display blocks preview immediately once the page editor loaded.

* **SEO Enhancements**
Additional support for content analysis in Rank Math and Yoast SEO plugins.

In the search field type ‚ÄúLazy Blocks‚Äù and click Search Plugins. Once you‚Äôve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking ‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù.

### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading our Lazy Blocks plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
